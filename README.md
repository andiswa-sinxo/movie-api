# movie-api
- The app is not working on heroku but I did depoly the server file to heroku
- I have not inserted the movies list on the user_playlist table
- The columns are not responsive
- I can insert the firstname, lastname, username and password on the user_details table
- Generated a token when a user is logged in and registering
- Hashed the password for the user when the user is loggin amd registering
- Used bootstrapp for the inputs and for the buttons
- When the user loggin, can be able to search for a movie and the app will display all the movies that has the name that the user search for
- Still have to work on the post route for the playlist and test it
- Haven't used cors
